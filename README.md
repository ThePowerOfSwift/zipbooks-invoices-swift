# zipbooks-invoices-swift
A simple iOS client for ZipBooks (www.zipbooks.com)

Just remember to do a `pod install` before running it.  

It let you list and visualize your invoices, add a time entry or add an expense.  
The official Zipbooks app will be ready soon, so I would suggest you wait for that unless you are a developer.
