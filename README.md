# zipbooks-invoices-swift
A simple iOS client for ZipBooks (www.zipbooks.com)

Just remember to do a `pod install` before running it.  
It's still work in progress, for now it's only possible to login, get a list of your invoice and visualize them.  
The official Zipbooks app will be ready soon so I would suggest you wait for that unless you are a developer.
